##API KEYS
##I had some trouble working through the API key. 
##I didn't realize that ChatGPT disables the code automatically when it's uploaded on Github.
##It took a while for me to realize this because the import openAI code just wouldn't work!
##So I uploaded the file in my cybox folder and been using that. I can't commit the changes on the Github desktop because of this
##Glad it works now

##File upload
##Wrote code to upload txt file

##Txt file convert to dictionaries
##This took a WHILE as well. 
##Extracted information needed from txt file and convert them to dictionaries on py file so that the data is stored internally
##QUESTION: Not sure how to "streamline" this process without having the user "write" the code for this. Perhaps that would come later when I build the web-app?

##Next things to do 
##1. Ask GPT the read the abstract and rate the relevance to the research question given
##2. Build GUI (hopefully...)
